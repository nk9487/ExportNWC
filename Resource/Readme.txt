Installation Instructions:

Option 1: Export using project list

1.Locate the "ExportSetting.json" file that is included with the program. Save or copy this file to a shared drive accessible by all employees in the company.

2.The "ExportSetting.json" file is formatted to store project information. Before adding a fourth project, the file should have the following structure:

[
	{
		"id": 1700,
		"path": "C:\\Users\\namun\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\NWC",
		"coordinate": "internal"
	},
	{
		"id": 1701,
		"path": "C:\\Users\\namun\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\NWC",
		"coordinate": "shared"
	},
	{
		"id": 1702,
		"path": "C:\\Users\\namun\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\NWC\\New folder",
		"coordinate": "shared"
	}
]

3.To add a new project, copy and paste the last project entry and adjust the settings accordingly. For example, if you wish to add a fourth project, modify the "ExportSetting.json" file as shown below:

[
	{
		"id": 1700,
		"path": "C:\\Users\\namun\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\NWC",
		"coordinate": "internal"
	},
	{
		"id": 1701,
		"path": "C:\\Users\\namun\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\NWC",
		"coordinate": "shared"
	},
	{
		"id": 1702,
		"path": "C:\\Users\\namun\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\NWC\\New folder",
		"coordinate": "shared"
	},
	{
		"id": 1703,
		"path": "C:\\Users\\namun\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\NWC\\",
